## What is Propulate?

A tool for hyperparameter search

- designed for HPC environments
- using MPI for scaling and communication
    - no ray or dask
    - no SQL
- decentralized
    - avoiding communication bottlenecks or load imbalances
- lazily synchronized
    - avoiding idle workers

---

## Optimization

- population based
- distributed over many workers
- evaluate individuals to inform future selection
- algorithms to propose new candidates:
    - random search
    - evolutionary search
    - CMA-ES
    - ...

---
## Communication

---
# Outlook

- Next release: better checkpointing
- bayesian search
- log sampling
